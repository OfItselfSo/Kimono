Simple Monitoring for Outback Power PV Systems

The Kimono software is a monitoring solution for solar power systems based on Outback Power PV equipment. Kimono runs on a Windows PC, talks to the Mate3s controller via that device's 
integrated web server and displays and records data sent to it from the PV system. It cannot update the configuration of the Outback equipment - it is purely read only.

The Kimono software is free, open source and is released under the MIT License. It is written in C#.

Although the Kimono software is simple to use, it incorporates quite a few interesting features. You should definitely watch the [Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtzF9pmowZg) in order to get a 
sense of how to work with it. 

The home page for this project can be found at [http://www.OfItselfSo.com/Kimono](http://www.OfItselfSo.com/Kimono). Please read the contents
of that page for detailed information regarding the softwares capabilities and usage instructions. A binary file is also available for those who do not wish to compile the C# source themselves.

The Kimono application is open source and released under the MIT License.
